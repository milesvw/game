# **Inspiration**

Wanting to educate younger people about the importance of eating healthy

## **What it does**

The code snippet is an HTML file that uses the Phaser game framework to create an educational game. 
It sets up the game environment, including the canvas size, physics, and scene. It loads the necessary assets such as images and spritesheets. 
It creates the player character, platforms, veggies, and sugar. It handles player movement and collision with the platforms, veggies, and sugar. 
It keeps track of the score and updates it when the player collects veggies which is good for the person's health. If the player comes in 
contact with the unhealthy sugar, the game ends.

## **How we built it**

We built using the Phaser framework, and collaboration through GitHub

## **Challenges we ran into**

Creating sprites using this framework was paywalled with poor outdated information.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We got the game running properly and debugged it despite our limited experience with game development.

## **What we learned**

I think the biggest challenge was building the game and finding a way to collaborate. We were all new to game development and under strong dedication, we were able to learn the phaser framework and get our educational game running. We also learned about Github live collab to interact in real-time with our team and other features such as Github pushes and pulls, branches, and pull requests.

## **What's next for Nutrition game**

Dynamic camera and deploy it to mobile devices.

## **Built With**
